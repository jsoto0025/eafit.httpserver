# Hypertext Transfer Protocol -- HTTP/1.1.

## Terminoligy

### message
The basic unit of HTTP communication, consisting of a structured sequence of octets matching the syntax
defined in section 4 and transmitted via the connection.

### request
An HTTP request message, as defined in section 5.

### response
An HTTP response message, as defined in section 6.

### client
A program that establishes connections for the purpose of sending requests.

### user agent
The client which initiates a request. These are often browsers, editors, spiders (web-traversing robots), or other
end user tools.

### server
An application program that accepts connections in order to service requests by sending back responses. Any
given program may be capable of being both a client and a server; our use of these terms refers only to the role
being performed by the program for a particular connection, rather than to the programâ€™s capabilities in general.
Likewise, any server may act as an origin server, proxy, gateway, or tunnel, switching behavior based on the
nature of each request.

## 1.4 Overall Operation

Most HTTP communication is initiated by a user agent and consists of a request to be applied to a resource on some
origin server. In the simplest case, this may be accomplished via a single connection (v) between the user agent (UA)
and the origin server (O).
